# About

This sets up my own custom development environment on any Ubuntu machine that I own. 

# Installation

Run 

    git clone git://github.com/AkshatM/configuration.git

in your home directory. This will create a read-only copy.

After installing, run `sudo ./launch.sh`, and you should be golden. You can run as many times as desired.
