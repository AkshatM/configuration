# About

This sets up my own custom development environment on any Ubuntu machine that I own. 

# Installation

Run 

    git clone git://github.com/AkshatM/configuration.git

in your home directory. This will create a read-only copy.

# Ubuntu 18.04
 
After installing, run `DEPLOY_ENV='v2019.2.0' sudo ./launch.sh`, and you should be golden. You can run as many times as desired.

# Ubuntu 20.04

After installing, run `DEPLOY_ENV='v3003' sudo ./launch.sh`, and you should be golden. You can run as many times as desired.
