# About

This sets up my own custom development environment on any Ubuntu machine that I own. 

# Installation

Simply run `launch.sh`, and you should be golden. You can run as many times as desired. 

To distribute this on a brand new machine, it's advised to copy a cloned version of this repo to a USB stick and run from there.
